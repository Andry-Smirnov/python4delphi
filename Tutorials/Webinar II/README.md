- Source code is included in this folder.  Demo33 is in the Demos directory and the python extension module demos are in the Modules directory.

Please note that to compile the source code you need to install the [SVGIconLibrary](https://github.com/EtheaDev/SVGIconImageList).  
PyChartHTML uses the TEdgeBrowser control.  So you need to use Delphi 10.4 or later and install the [WebView2 Runtime](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/webview2/).  The required WebView2Loader.dll is already in the output folder.  Finally the visualization and analytics demos make use of a range of python modules that need to be installed in python using the python package installer pip. These needed modules are listed below:

- numpy
- pandas
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- mpld3
- bokeh
- altair
- scikit-learn
