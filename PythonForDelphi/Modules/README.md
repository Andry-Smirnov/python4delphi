# Using P4D as a Python extension module

The project in the subdirectory Delphi generates a Python library (a dynamic link library with extension "pyd" in Windows) that allows you to create user interfaces using  delphi from within python.  The small demo TestApp.py gives you a flavour of what is possible.   The machinery by which this is achived is the WrapDelphi unit.
