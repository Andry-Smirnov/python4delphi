## P4D Installation using [MultiInstaller](https://github.com/pyscripter/MultiInstaller)

Use for Delphi Tokyo (10.2) or later to install all packages in one step.  For versions earlier than Delphi Seattle (10.4) select only the first package in step 2 and manually add the Source\Vcl folder to the search path.   

Requires Delphi

1. Clone or copy the Python4Delphi git repository to a folder of your choice.  The setup.ini file assumes that the folder is called "P4D".  If you chose to name your folder differently then modify setup.ini accordingly.
2. Run MultiInstaller.exe
3. Select the packages you want and press Next
4. In the dialog box specify the parent folder of "P4D" (i.e. the folder containing the directory to which you have copied Python4Delphi) and the Delphi target version.  Then press Next to install the components
